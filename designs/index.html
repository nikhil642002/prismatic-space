					In its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996, the International Court of Justice found that the influence of the use of nuclear weapons on human civilizations and environment could be totally destructive, while the States are independent and sovereign, which means they do have rights to use nuclear weapons for self-defense in armed conflicts under extreme circumstances. So each case involving the use of nuclear weapons needs to be considered separately depending on its own circumstances.

					So if Asgardia is recognized as a State by the United Nations, which means a State can claim territory in space, then the Outer Space Treaty’s intention of keeping the space as an international resource may be compromised. After all, if one bilionaire can create an Asgardia, it won’t be difficult for other bilionaires to create Asjedi, Asjoda, or some other bizarrely named Space Nations, all they have to do is to gather some data from people and send them into space with a satellite.

					The Great Wall of China was built during the long history when airplanes and marine technologies were not available, and natural obstacles such as the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding seas could effectively stop the nomadic tribes from invading the Central China Plain. As time went by, its function as defence diminished greatly when modern technologies entered into the arena of wars.
